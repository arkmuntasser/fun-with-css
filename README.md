Having Fun with CSS
=================

Examples using lesser known CSS.

## Examples

### The `attr()` function

A demonstration of the `attr()` function to create text that inverts color part of the way through.

### Use `background-repeat: round`

Not all patterns make sense to repeat and show only a fraction of the image. This forces the repeat to always show the entire image.

### Tabular Numbers

Don't you hate it when you make a counter and the numbers bounce horizontally? Me too! This prevents that.

### The `currentColor` value vs CSS Custom Properties

It's like a CSS Custom Property, but just for color and supported damn near everywhere!

### Custom bullets

Why use the typical lame bullets when you can bullets with style?

### px vs rem vs em

Why? What? When?
